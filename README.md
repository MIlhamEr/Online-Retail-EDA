# Online-Retail-EDA

I led a strategic initiative involving extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on large-scale retail datasets using Python. The primary goal was to unveil dataset properties, identify patterns, anomalies, and emerging trends. This comprehensive analysis, blending statistical methodologies and data visualization, delved into the intricacies of the data. 

# Approach
1. Importing the required libraries.
2. Load the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame and display the first few rows to get an overview of the data.
3. Explore the basic statistics of the dataset.
4. Perform data cleaning by handling missing values, if any, and removing any unnecessary data.
5. Removing outliers that will interfere with the analysis.
6. Analyze customer trend transactions and countries that make a lot of transactions.
7. Draw conclusions from the exploratory data analysis.
